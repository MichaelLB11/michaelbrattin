          Christian Campus House seeks to provide a caring fellowship where college age people can find and expand their relationship with God and learn to be doers of the Word.
          </br></br>
          For the past 40 years,  hundreds of students have found fellowship, encouragement, teaching from God&#39;s Word, counsel, training, service, and excitement about being a part of the body of Christ.
          </br></br>
          Many of those students have gone on to serve on the mission field and in various forms of ministry.  Many others are practicing their faith in the fields of law, medicine, education, business, social services, and more. Dozens of former CCH students serve as leaders of their local congregations and are involved in a variety of community efforts.
          </br></br>
          College is a pivotal stage of life. We encourage students to spend these years growing in their relationship with God and others, and being a part of what God is doing in the world.
